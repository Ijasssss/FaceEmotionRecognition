```markdown
# 😊 Face Emotion Recognition System

A deep learning-based web application that detects human emotions in real-time using a webcam feed. Built using OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, and Python, this project aims to identify facial expressions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, etc.

---

## 📌 Features

- Detects faces from live webcam feed using OpenCV.
- Classifies facial emotions using a CNN model.
- Supports multiple emotion classes: `Happy`, `Sad`, `Angry`, `Surprise`, `Neutral`, etc.
- Real-time video inference and display.
- Easy-to-use interface and modular code.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: OpenCV GUI (live video feed)
- **Backend**: Python
- **ML/DL Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Others**: NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter, Haarcascade

## 📈 Dataset Used

- **FER-2013**: Facial Expression Recognition dataset containing grayscale images categorized into various emotions.
- Download from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-emotion-recognition.git
cd face-emotion-recognition
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
python src/predict.py
```

A webcam window will open and start detecting your emotion in real-time.

---

## 🧠 Training the Model (Optional)

```bash
python src/train.py
```

Ensure you have the FER2013 dataset placed in the correct directory and preprocessed.
